Student- Teacher relationship has evolved over the WEB CLASS in these recent times because of the pandemic. Through the use of Internet the interaction between student and teacher has increased. So through our project we will create an App for Educational Purpose which will provide students effective and interactive learning and at the same it will reduce the work of teachers because all the educational institutes have shifted to online platform as everything is closed due the worldwide pandemic situation. Our App is a new approach of classroom learning. It provides an option for the teachers to upload teaching material which are related to the topic taught in the class. It provides an opportunity for the students to learn from the material which will provided by the their teacher and they donâ€™t need to any books for that purpose. This feature is helpful for the students who are afraid to ask doubts in the class. 
             Virtual education is an emerging concept. Here the classes are not taken face-to-face in a classroom but through an electronic medium as a substitute. These virtual classrooms are gaining importance every day and very soon they are going to be an integral part of our world. As the number of Internet access points are growing rapidly, E-Learning is also gaining a new peak. This electronic medium serves best for dissemination of information. E-Learning is proving itself as a boon for students especially for the disabled who are not able to go and attend the lectures. All these emphasis the need for developing an Open Source Application that can be used to generate rich multimedia presentation for E-Learning.
